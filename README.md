[Spout](https://spout.zeal.co/) is a video frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows, which allows applications to share OpenGL textures in a similar way to [Syphon](https://github.com/Syphon) for the Mac.

Spout supports DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX 12 and OpenGL textures and includes a developer SDK and sample applications.

For questions and suggestions please contact the [Spout Discourse Group](https://spout.discourse.group/). Please reserve repository Issues for code development.
