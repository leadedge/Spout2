"Spout2" is a revision of "Spout" (http://spout.zeal.co/), a video frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows, which allows applications for Microsoft Windows to share OpenGL 
textures between each other in a similar way to Syphon for the Mac.

Spout2 has been completely re-written and supports DirectX 11 textures. The initial release
is compatible with existing DirectX 9 Spout plugins and applications.

Spout2 includes a developer SDK and sample applications. SpoutSDK is preliminary pending
testing and is subject to change. If you are interested in assisting with development testing,
please contact us on the Spout developer forum :
