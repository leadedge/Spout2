This folder contains all the source files necessary for your C++ application to use the Spout SDK. You can also use a dll if you prefer. The ["SpoutLibrary"](https://spoutlibrary-site.netlify.app/) C-compatible dll be used for compilers other than Visual Studio.

Build the dll using CMake. Refer to "Building the libraries.pdf" at the root of the repository.

Refer to the [documentation](https://spoutgl-site.netlify.app/) for details on how to use files within and application and to use the SDK as a dll.

The ["SpoutDX"](https://spoutdx-site.netlify.app/) class is designed for DirectX 11 applications rather than OpenGL. Refer to the *..\SPOUTSDK\SpoutDirectX* folder.
