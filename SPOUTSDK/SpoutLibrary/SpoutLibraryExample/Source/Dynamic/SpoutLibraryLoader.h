//
//	SpoutLibraryLoader.h
//
//	Dynamic load of SpoutLibrary.dll
//
//	Use this if SpoutLibrary.lib is not compatible with your compiler,
//  or to allow user update of SpoutLibrary.dll without application rebuild.
//
//	Loads SpoutLibrary.dll and gets the entry point for the function that
//	creates an instance of SpoutLibrary. This is the only exported function
//	for SpoutLirbary.
//
//	SpoutLibrary.lib does not need to be linked during build
//	Other examples use SpoutLibrary.lib for the linker.
